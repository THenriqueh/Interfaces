A company wants to automate the processing of its contracts. the processing of
a contract consists of generating the installments to be paid for that contract, based on the
desired number of months.
The company uses an online payment service to pay the installments.
Online payment services typically charge a monthly interest as well as a fee.
per payment. For now, the service hired by the company is Paypal, which applies
1% simple interest on each installment, plus a 2% payment fee.
Write a program to read data from a contract (contract number, contract date,
and total contract value). Then the program should read the number of months to
installment of the contract, and then generate the records of installments to be paid (date and amount),
the first installment being paid one month after the contract date, the second installment two
months after the contract and so on. Show plot data on screen.
