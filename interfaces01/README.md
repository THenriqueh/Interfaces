A Brazilian car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals of up to
12 hours. However, if the lease duration is 12 hours, the lease will be
billed based on a daily rate. In addition to the lease amount, it is added to the
price the tax amount according to the country's rules which, in the case of Brazil, is 20%
for amounts up to 100.00, or 15% for amounts over 100.00. Make one
program that reads the lease data (car model, start and end time of
Lease), as well as the hourly rate and the daily rental rate. The program
must generate the payment note (containing lease amount, then
tax and total payment amount) and enter the data on the screen. see the
examples.
